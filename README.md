# Transcriptomics
The aim of this mini-project was to produce a R-markdown document, specifically, a html file, containing a work-through of a transcriptomic analysis pipeline applied to the "Transcriptome profile of Primary Human Lung Fibroblasts (Cystic Fibrosis vs. Non-Cystic Fibrosis) [2D]" dataset (GEO accession number: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE141535">GSE141535</a>). 

An analytical pipeline was created by piecing together requisite R packages, as appropriate for the chosen dataset. The workflow should included post-processing and preliminary exploration of the dataset, analysis for differentially expressed genes, and analysis for enriched Gene Ontology and/or pathway terms.
